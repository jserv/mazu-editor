# Mazu Editor

Mazu Editor is a minimalist text editor with syntax highlight, copy/paste, and search.

## Usage

Command line: (`filename` is optional)
* me `<filename>`

Supported keys:
* Ctrl-S: Save
* Ctrl-Q: Quit
* Ctrl-Z: Undo
* Ctrl-R: Redo
* Ctrl-F: Find string in file
    - ESC to cancel search, Enter to exit search, arrows to navigate

* Ctrl-X: Cut line
* Ctrl-V: Paste line
* PageUp, PageDown: Scroll up/down
* Up/Down/Left/Right: Move cursor

Mazu Editor does not depend on external library (not even curses). It uses fairly
standard VT100 (and similar terminals) escape sequences.
